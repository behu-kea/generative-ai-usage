Hey ChatGPT...

You will help create exercises for a specific topic. The exercises will be for a software development class.

To generate exercises start with asking the user for the following:

1. What programming language?
2. How many exercises?
3. What topics should the students learn in the class?
4. What prerequisites are relevant for the class?

Now generate exercises. The exercises should be didactical and padegogical excellent. 

The exercise should be outputted as markdown. The exercises should be interesting, real world and unique. Every exercise should have a level from 1-3. 

Very important! Don't write the solution for the exercises in the output! Very important!

Here is an example:

Example 1
User input:

1. Javascript
2. 12
3. Creating an array. Index. Array methods: push and indexOf. Iterating an array. Conditional logic in array
4. The students have learned about variables, loops, conditional

### 📝 Exercise 1 - level 1

Create an array that contains a list of your interests. Get the number of interests you have added to the list. Give the variable a good name

Log out the following string `I have 10 interests`

### 📝 Exercise 2 - level 1

Using the following array

```javascript
const fruits = ["banana", "apple", "strawberry", "kiwi", "fig", "orange"];
```

Now, using the correct indexes, print the following values from the array:

- strawberry
- kiwi
- orange
- banana

### 📝 Exercise 3 - level 2

Write some code that can get the first and last elements in an array.

```javascript
const names = ['Peter', 'Susan', 'Charlotte'];
// Use the names array
const firstNameInArray = YOU WRITE CODE HERE;
const lastNameInArray = YOU WRITE CODE HERE;

console.log(firstNameInArray); // Peter
console.log(lastNameInArray); // Charlotte

const fruits = ['pear', 'banana', 'apple', 'grape'];
const firstFruitInArray = YOU WRITE CODE HERE;
const lastFruitInArray = YOU WRITE CODE HERE;

console.log(firstFruitInArray); // pear
console.log(lastFruitInArray); // grape
```

## Array methods

There are **lots** of different array methods. Today we will focus the two most important ones

### `.push`

Elements can be "pushed" into an array. The pushed element will figure as the latest element.

```javascript
const trainees = ["Ahmed", "Maria", "Atanas", "Nahidul", "Jack"];

trainees.push("Nicklas");

console.log(trainees); // ["Ahmed", "Maria", "Bianca", "Nahidul", "Jack", "Nicklas"]
```

### `.indexOf`

If you know the value and want the index number, you can use indexOf

```javascript
const trainees = ["Ahmed", "Maria", "Atanas", "Nahidul", "Jack"];

const indexOfMaria = trainees.indexOf("Maria");

console.log(indexOfMaria); // 1
```

More methods documented [here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp)

### 📝 Exercise 4 - Favorite Songs - level 2

1. Create an array called `favoriteSongs` and add five of your favorite song titles.
2. Use the `.push` method to add another song to the end of the array.
3. Use the `indexOf` method to find the position of a song in the array.

## Iterating an array

Iterating an array is about going through each element in an array. Here is an example

```javascript
const names = ["Benjamin", "Mie", "Klara"];
// Instead of doing this 👇 (what if we had 1000 elements in the array 😱)
console.log(names[0]); // Benjamin
console.log(names[1]); // Mie
console.log(names[2]); // Klara

// Do this:
for (const name of names) {
  // This log is called 3 times because there are 3 elements in the array
  console.log(name);
}
// this will log Benjamin then Mie then Klara
```

### For...of

```javascript
const cars = ["fiat", "volvo", "peugeot"];

for (const car of cars) {
  console.log(car);
}

// Output: "fiat"
// Output: "volvo"
// Output: "peugeot"
```

### ForEach

Does the same, but we can get the index aswell!

```javascript
const cars = ["fiat", "volvo", "peugeot"];

cars.forEach((car, index) => {
  console.log(index, car);
});

// Output: "0 fiat"
// Output: "1 volvo"
// Output: "2 peugeot"
```

### 📝 Exercise 6 - In class let's analyze this code

```javascript
let b = [3, 7, 2, 9, 5];
let r = [];
let t = 0;

for (let p = 0; p < b.length; p++) {
  t = b[p] * 2;
  r[r.length] = t;
}

for (let x = 0; x < r.length; x++) {
  console.log("r is: " + r[x]);
}
```

### 📝 Exercise 5 - teachers and students

Duration: 20 min

In the following exercise one group will randomly be selected to be teachers and the other group will be students

In groups of two people prepare a small 5 minute lecture. The lecture should explain the topic of **forEach** or **for...of** any way you like. That might be with a small slideshow or it might be with code, thats up to you.

- As teachers present the 5 minute lecture
- As students ask good interesting questions

### 📝 Exercise 7 - Analyze this code

Ask the following questions

- What does this code do/what should it do?
- How would you improve it?
- Does it work?
- Do you like the variable names?
- Is the code easy to understand?

```javascript
let givenArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let revarr = [];

givenArray.forEach((element, index) => {
  revarr[index] = givenArray[givenArray.length + index];
});

console.log(revarr);
```

### 📝 Exercise 8 - level 2

Given the following array:

```javascript
const words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"];
```

Write a program that prints out each word and its length.

Here is the expected output:

```
apple: 5
banana: 6
cherry: 6
date: 4
elderberry: 10
```

### 📝 Exercise 9 - level 2

Given the following array:

```javascript
const animals = ["cat", "dog", "bird", "fish", "elephant"];
```

Write code that finds the index of 'bird' in the array and then replaces it with 'parrot'. Print the updated array.

Expected output: `['cat', 'dog', 'parrot', 'fish', 'elephant']`

### 📝 Exercise 10 - level 3

Given the following array:

```javascript
const grades = [85, 90, 78, 88, 76, 95, 89];
```

Write code that

1. Calculates the total grades from the array
2. Calculates the average grades in the the array

Expected output: `Average grade is 86`

### 📝 Exercise 11 - level 3

Using the following array:

```javascript
const words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "fig"];
```

Write code that prints the words that have more than 5 letters.

Expected output: `banana cherry`

### 📝 Exercise 12 - level 3: Data Filtering

You are given an array of user input data. Each item in the array is a string that a user has entered into a search bar on a website.

```javascript
const searchData = [
  "apple",
  "banana  ",
  "  Cherry",
  "apple ",
  "APPLE",
  "  Banana",
];
```

1. Clean the data: Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each item.
2. Standardize the data: Convert all items to lowercase so that the search is case-insensitive.
3. Remove any duplicate items from the array.

Print the cleaned and standardized array

Expected output: `['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']`
