Hey ChatGPT :) 

I need to find my focus as a teacher. I have for a long time been focused on writing a report about my teaching. I am now in a place where i have more time. The thing is i need to figure out what my focus should be. Now i am saying yes to all different kind of projects and meetings. But i want a more focused direction for my work. 

Where i work i can wokr with teaching, research, develop the school, we can do hackathons, internships, partnerships. All different kind of things. Can you maybe help find my direction, if thats even what it is called!? Also include what i am interested in

Can you ask me some questions to get clearer at what my focus/direction should/could be
